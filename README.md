## How To Install

Simple explanations on how to install this addon to your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly install.

### Using Mod Organiser 2(MO2)

To install the addon with MO2, simply open MO2 and select "Install Mod" in the top left. Then select the `ITsPorkys_ToggleAutoRun.zip`. Then make sure to tick the checkbox in MO2 before launching.

### Manually Install of Addon

To install the addon manually, you will need to unzip the `ITsPorkys_ToggleAutoRun.zip`. Then you will need to copy/paste or drag the `gamedata` folder across to the root directory of your `S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly` install. This will add the files and scripts needed for the addon to the games `gamedata` directory.

## Addon Configuration Instructions and Recommendations

Hi Stalkers, just thought I'd give you an explanation for using/configuring this Toggle Auto Run addon.

The default configuration for this mod (The way I like to use it) is with the `[CAPS LOCK]` key for both "Auto-Run" and "Auto-Sprint", "Auto-Run" is toggled by single tapping `[CAPS LOCK]`, "Auto-Sprint" is toggled by double tapping `[CAPS LOCK]`.

This addon allows you to toggle "Auto-Run" and "Auto-Sprint". This can be bound to the same key or seperate keys. This is achieved by making use of the Mod Configuration Manager(MCM), it allows you to select your toggle options for the bound key(s). I have removed the "hold key" option from MCM as it is a little janky/broken when the same key bind is used.

## Features

- Toggle Auto-Run and Auto-Sprint.
- Seperate or same key toggle options for "Run" and "Sprint".
- Pressing "W" or "S" while the auto run/sprint is active will cancel the action so you can move freely.
- Toggling either "Auto-Run" or "Auto-Sprint" while either are already enabled will disable the action.
- Pressing "A" or "D" while the auto run/sprint is active won't cancel the action, and instead will allow you to strafe and make much needed adjustments to dodge anomalies ;).
- Ability to set a key binds within the MCM screen in the games menu.
- Ability to set a Toggle mode within the MCM screen, the options are:
  - Single tap
  - Double tap
- Ability to set a Toggle modifier within the MCM screen, the options are:
  - None
  - Shift key
  - Alt key
- MCM menu translated to English and Russian.

## Mod Configuration Menu(MCM) Integration

This addon uses the MCM addon created by [RavenAscendant](https://github.com/RAX-Anomaly), and allows a menu to be created for the player(yes that's you) to change settings/ configurations for the addon. This addon adds the ability to change the keybind to a key you wish to assign it too, there is also the ability to configure the "Toggle Mode" and "Toggle Modifier".

The MCM Tab for this addon is "TAR - Toggle Auto Run"

### MCM Options

- Key Bind: can be changed within the Mod Configuration Manager(MCM) screen in the games menu.
- Toggle Mode: can be adjusted in the MCM screen, the options are:
  - Single tap
  - Double tap
- Toggle Modifier: can be adjusted in the MCM screen, the options are:
  - None
  - Shift key
  - Alt key
