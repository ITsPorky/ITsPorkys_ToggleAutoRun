## Mod Configuration Menu(MCM) Integration

This addon uses the MCM addon created by [RavenAscendant](https://github.com/RAX-Anomaly), and allows a menu to be created for the user(yes that's you) to change settings/ configurations for the addon. For this addon, I have added the ability to change the keybind to a key you wish to assign it too. There is also the ability to configure the "Toggle Mode" and "Toggle Modifier".

The MCM Tab for this addon is "TAR - Toggle Auto Run"
